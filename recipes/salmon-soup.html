    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>4 servings</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 salmon fillet of about 400 grams</li>
        <li>1 to 1.5 liters of fish stock</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>8 medium-sized firm-fleshed potatoes</li>
        <li>5 peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 or 2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 dl of cooking cream</li>
        <li>the equivalent of 2 tablespoons of butter</li>
        <li>a bunch of dill</li>
        <li>a bunch of chives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the fish stock until boiling. Add the chopped onion, peppercorns, and bay leaves all at once.</li>
        <li>While the broth is simmering, peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes (or chunks) one or two centimeters on each side. Add them to the broth as soon as they are ready, and leave them there until they are half cooked, about ten minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the skin from the salmon fillet. This is the only slightly tricky part of this recipe: the best thing to do is to take a long, sharp knife, place the salmon on its skin, one hand on top, and slide the knife between the flesh and the skin. Then cut the flesh into cubes about 2 cm on each side, then add them to the saucepan with the stock. Simmer until the salmon is cooked, that is, until the flesh is clear throughout and loosens a little; this happens quickly, barely ten minutes. Meanwhile, chop the dill and chives.</li>
        <li>When the salmon is cooked, turn off the heat under the soup. Add the butter, stirring until completely melted, then the cream. While stirring, try to retrieve the bay leaf(s). Check the seasoning: fish stock is usually salty enough that you don't need to add salt to the soup, but a little pepper is sometimes welcome. Then add the chopped dill and chives, and stir one last time.</li>
    </ol>
