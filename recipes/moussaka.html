    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious dish from Greece, made with minced beef meat and eggplant. Takes time to cook, but it's definitely worth tasting!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>4 servings</p>

    <p>For the moussaka :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggplants</li>
        <li>5 tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>6 potatoes</li>
        <li>500G minced beef meat</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>30g butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>nutmeg</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the bechamel sauce :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>20g butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>35cl milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preparation of the tomato sauce. Slice the onions and brown them in a small saucepan.</li>
        <li>Add the roughly diced tomatoes and 2 good tablespoons of olive oil, the cinnamon, the honey, and season with salt and pepper. Reduce everything for 25 minutes (or more, until the meat is tender) over medium heat. You should have a sauce, which can be smoothed with ready-made tomato puree.</li>
        <li>Preparing the eggplants. Slice the eggplants into rounds (without peeling them), salt them generously, and let them drain while you complete the next step. Tip for draining the eggplants: In a dish, alternate a layer of salted eggplant slices with a layer of paper towels, or leave them in a colander.</li>
        <li>Preparing the potatoes. Peel and cut the potatoes into thin slices.</li>
        <li>Place the potato slices in the bottom of a fairly deep, oiled baking dish. Sprinkle the potatoes with a little (3 tablespoons) of the juice from the simmering tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Place the potato dish under the grill for 5 to 15 minutes depending on your oven, until golden.</li>
        <li>Now that they have drained, put the eggplant slices in a pan over high heat to brown them a little on each side, set aside.</li>
        <li>Preparing the meat. In a saucepan, brown the minced meat in butter over a fairly high heat, add salt and pepper, and drain the water released by the meat.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato-onion sauce and reduce the heat (very low).</li>
        <li>Remove the potato dish from the oven and preheat the oven to 200°C (gas mark 6-7).</li>
        <li>Preparation of the béchamel sauce. In a small saucepan over low heat, brown the 20g of butter, add the flour and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the milk, stirring constantly. This can take a good 10 minutes and you should get a fairly thick sauce.</li>
        <li>Add salt, pepper and a little nutmeg (it's strong, so you don't need to use much).</li>
        <li>Assembling the moussaka. On top of the potato layer, spread half of the minced meat with the tomato, then half of the eggplant, then the other half of the meat, then the other half of the eggplant, a drizzle of olive oil and finish with the béchamel sauce.</li>
        <li>Place everything in the oven at 200°C (thermostat 6-7) and cook for 1 hour (the béchamel sauce should be crispy and golden).</li>
    </ol>
